I've written a small collection of scripts which are useful to use while conducting a pentest. **dnslist_net** is only one of them. Reconnaissance has a very important role in the pentesting process, and this is a tool to assist you with that. You can thank the developers at FarSight Security for compiling this database and making it publicly available & accessible through their hosts dnslist.net and dnsdb.org. Their database is quite extensive and does offer even more information if you request an API key and use the APIs written by FarSight.
